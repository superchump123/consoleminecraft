This is a simple idea I created to utilize different language features and explore different programming languages.
It is designed to have enough complexity to where it can be easily duplicated in many different programming languages, but still allow exploration and varying ways of performing certain tasks.
That being said, no version is necessarily intended to contain the most optimal code in terms of performance.  This is strictly an educational project.  However, readability IS and should be taken into account when editing.

# __Project description:__
The project is a simple text representation of a Minecraft hotbar. "Players" may use basic inventory management commands to give themselves items and then manipulate those items' positions in the hotbar.
It's a stupid concept, but it's been great in increasing my comfort level with a variety of basic and intermediate Python concepts, such as dictionaries, return statements, conditionals, break and continue statements, and the standard library modules json and sys.
This project also allowed me to learn how to manage a multi-file Python program, and even led to the building of my second webscraper (to save two or three hours of typing) with BeautifulSoup!
Furthermore, this project is the first in which I have tried using source control (Git), and has led me to finally understand concepts like staging, commiting, and pushing.

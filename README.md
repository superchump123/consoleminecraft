This is a simple idea I created to utilize different language features and
explore different programming languages. It is designed to have enough complexity to where
it can be easily duplicated in many different programming languages, but still allow exploration and
varying ways of performing certain tasks.
That being said, no version is necessarily intended to contain the most optimal code in terms of performance.  This is
strictly an educational project.  However, readability IS and should be taken into account when editing.

This is a simple idea I created to utilize different language features and explore different programming languages.
It is designed to have enough complexity to where it can be easily duplicated in many different programming languages, but still allow exploration and varying ways of performing certain tasks.
That being said, no version is necessarily intended to contain the most optimal code in terms of performance.  This is strictly an educational project.  However, readability IS and should be taken into account when editing.

# __Project description:__
The project is a simple text representation of a Minecraft hotbar. "Players" may give themselves items, add more items to existing hotbar slots, and remove all items from item slots. There are also some fun meme commands.
